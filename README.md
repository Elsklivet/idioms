# Idioms

Certain algorithms or pieces of code tend to prop up frequently in solutions to coding problems. I got tired of forgetting some of them and having to look them up and tear through various sources, so I decided to make this repository to hold common programming idioms to refer to.

Please feel free to make pull requests with anything you think is idiomatic. I don't care how simple it is. Please leave a pull request showing Selection Sort. I do not care. Also use any programming language you want. I am going to just keep adding stuff to this when I am bored.
